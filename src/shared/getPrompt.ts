- Each chapter must have a title and description.
- Description should be 6-8 sentences long.
- Include a boolean field "is_study_case" to indicate if the chapter is a study case.

    Return ONLY a valid Markdown string as the final output.
    - Maximum heading level is ## (no #).
    - Wrap the entire content starting with ## Chapter ${chapterOrderIndex}: ${chapterName}.
    - Do NOT include <html>, <head>, or <body>.
    - Use semantic Markdown tags like ##, ###, -, 1., \`inline code\`, and fenced code blocks.
    - Do NOT return JSON, HTML tags, or extra explanations.
    - The response must be pure Markdown.

    Context:
    - Is Chapter a study case: ${isStudyCase}
    - Course overview: ${courseDesc}  
    - Chapter order index: ${chapterOrderIndex}  
    - Chapter: ${chapterName}  
    - Chapter summary: ${chapterDesc}

    Content requirements (for non-study case chapters):
    1. What (introduction to the topic)  
    2. Why (importance and relevance)  
    3. Tools/Libraries (if applicable)  
    4. Steps/Concepts (ordered explanation)

    Notes:
     - For study case chapter, the user can submit a result link of the study case (e.g github links, deployment link, gdrive link (txt file, gdocs file, etc.), etc.). 
       So make it the study case implementable so that user can submit a link. 

    Special formatting rules:
    - Inline code snippets inside a sentence → \`inline code\`
    - Full multi-line code examples → 
      \`\`\`language
      ...code here...
      \`\`\`
